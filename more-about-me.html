            HELLO THERE! Everybody has some hobbies and here you can learn about mine!!! :D
        </h1>

        <div class="left"><p>
            My biggest hobby throughout the years were always Role PLaying Games - but not on consoles or PC, but so called tabletop. That means you don't need practicaly anything to play - just some friends and dice. Of course there are lots of different kinds of RPGs, different systems and different worlds to play in. Since my history with those games goes back to my elementary school it's no surprise I played a lot of them. That said my first one - Warhammer fantasy - is still my favorite even though I know its far from perfect, or even a good system.

            I had a few collectible hobbies in my life, but two of them really stuck in my memory. Both really expensive. Both really really cool. Both I spend few years on. What were they? First - battle game with figurines, I got into collecting, glueing and sometimes painting (but not a lot) back in elementary school and kept doing it for a 3 years at least. The other one was Magic The Gathering - one of the most popular collectible card games in the world. I just recently got out of it and gave all my cards to my cousin, who I got into the game in my place :D

            Those hobbies above are all more or less in my past (though I revisit them all from time to time and they still mean a lot to me hehe) but the one I will present now is what I do in my free time now and its gaming. I played games since I was a kid but only few years ago I started getting into it more. Now I even play in community tournaments. That said I'm not good enough to go pro - not by a long shot - but I really enjoy playing just for fun. But "I play games" is too little to say isn't it? What games? There are so many tho! Well, I play overwatch (the tournaments I mentioned), genshin impact is what I play nowadays the most and of course a lot of little games, some singleplayer, but mostly I play with friends.

            The last entry here is not really a hobby but it's something I'm a big fan of. Hollywood Undead, it's a band making music in a buntch of genres, but making rock/metal songs mostly. I wanted to mention them cause I'm a really a huge fan for a few years now. I went to their concert only once unfortunatelly but I plan to go to a lot more when they will perform somewhere near me. I bought a lot of their merch, mostly clothes, and when I have a chance I will buy more for sure :D It's also the only band I still buy physical copies of albums.

            Of course I do a lot more things in my free time, not only those... Trust me.... Really though, of course I watch movies and Netflix like everyone. I go out with friends, I play with my dog, surf the net, work out, all that stuff. But I wanted to go into only the more interesting. I hope you're satisfied, and...
